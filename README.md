Sage is a WordPress starter theme based on HTML5 Boilerplate, gulp, Bower, and Bootstrap Sass, that will help you make better themes.

HOWEVER

Since Sage v9 is still in alpha and I'm constantly using version 8.5.0, and I didn't like some stuff such as bower and bootstrap, I adapted to fit my own needs. 


## Requirements

| Prerequisite    | How to check | How to install
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| PHP >= 5.4.x    | `php -v`     | [php.net](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) |
| Node.js >= 4.5  | `node -v`    | [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) |
| gulp >= 3.8.10  | `gulp -v`    | `npm install -g gulp` |

For more installation notes, refer to the [Install gulp and Bower](#install-gulp-and-bower) section in this document.

## Features

* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build script that compiles both Sass and Less, checks for JavaScript errors, optimizes images, and concatenates and minifies files
* [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for keeping multiple browsers and devices synchronized while testing, along with injecting updated CSS and JS into your browser while you're developing
* `assets/config.json` for the JSON file based asset pipeline
* [Uikit](https://getuikit.com/)
* [Theme wrapper](https://roots.io/sage/docs/theme-wrapper/)
* ARIA roles and microformats
* Posts use the [hNews](http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews) microformat
* [Multilingual ready](https://roots.io/wpml/) and over 30 available [community translations](https://github.com/roots/sage-translations)

Install the [Soil](https://github.com/roots/soil) plugin to enable additional features:

* Cleaner output of `wp_head` and enqueued assets
* Cleaner HTML output of navigation menus
* Root relative URLs
* Nice search (`/search/query/`)
* Google CDN jQuery snippet from [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* Google Analytics snippet from [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

See a complete working example in the [roots-example-project.com repo](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

## Theme installation

Install MySage by copying the project into a new folder within your WordPress themes directory.

Install Sage using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```shell
# @ example.com/site/web/app/themes/
$ git clone https://github.com/luism-s/mySage.git your-theme-name 8.5.0
```

## Theme setup

Edit `lib/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install gulp and NPM

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `gulp watch` you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/config.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

For example, if your local development URL is `http://project-name.dev` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://project-name.dev"
  }
...
```
If your local development URL looks like `http://localhost:8888/project-name/` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://localhost:8888/project-name/"
  }
...
```
